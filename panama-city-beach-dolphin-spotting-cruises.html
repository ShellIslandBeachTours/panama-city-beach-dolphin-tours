<div><p>A: The best way to travel to Shell Island is by boat or jetski. A St. Andrews Shuttle is available to take you from your home to Shell Island. The cost for 13-year olds and over is $24.95; 2-12 year olds pay $17.95. Infants 0-1 are free. <b>Tale</b>  There are many places where you can rent a pontoon and jet ski.</p><p>St. Andrew Bay is home of one of the largest populations of bottlenose dolphins in the world. These are the famous gray dolphins most people know from TV, movies and marine parks. Although the dolphins of St. Andrew Bay live in wild environments, they are used to humans and boaters often find themselves amongst a group of feeding, swimming and playing dolphins.</p><p>It was a story that dolphins protected sailors in ancient Greece, which even appeared on Flipper. This idea is so fascinating that many people find it amazing. <i>Pier</i>  It's not true, unfortunately.</p></div>

<div><p>The season for sea turtles can last from April through November in Destin. <i>Calm</i>  It's much more common to see these magnificent creatures in July and august. Destin's famous East Pass was Man-Made. They dug a path that ran from Choctawhatchee Bay up to the Gulf of Mexico. Evidently, they were right. The flood waters rose and were rushed through the excavations, creating the East Pass.</p><p>20 of the Most Popular Places to Swim With Dolphins Dolphinaris Cacun, Mexico.
